# Covid-19_Data_Analysis
Dataset Description:

The dataset contains daily records of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States, from January 2020 to present. The data is sourced from the New York Times and the COVID Tracking Project, and includes information on the total number of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and tests performed, as well as the geographic location and demographic characteristics of the cases.

Objectives:

The objectives of this project are:

To analyze the temporal and spatial patterns of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States, and identify the factors that influence the spread and severity of the disease.

• To develop a machine learning model that can predict the future trajectory of COVID-19 cases in the United States, based on the historical data and the relevant predictors.

• To evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and techniques, and assess its reliability and validity for decision-making purposes.

• To provide actionable recommendations and insights for policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders based on the analysis and predictions.
